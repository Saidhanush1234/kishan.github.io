    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: crimson;">DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH PLASTIC EFECT THE ENVIRONMENT</h1>
    <p style="color: aliceblue;">
        Plastic has several adverse effects on the environment. Here are some ways in which plastic impacts the environment:
        
        <li>Pollution: Plastic pollution is a significant concern worldwide. Improper disposal and lack of recycling infrastructure result in plastic waste ending up in landfills, water bodies, and natural habitats. This pollution harms ecosystems, wildlife, and aquatic life.
        
            <li>Marine Life: Plastic waste that enters oceans and waterways poses a severe threat to marine life. Marine animals, such as turtles, seabirds, and marine mammals, often mistake plastic debris for food or get entangled in plastic waste, leading to injury, suffocation, or death.
        
                <li> Habitat Destruction: Plastic pollution can cause habitat destruction. Plastic debris can accumulate in sensitive habitats such as coral reefs, wetlands, and forests, disrupting the balance of ecosystems and damaging critical breeding and feeding grounds for various species.
        
                    <li> Microplastics: Microplastics, tiny plastic particles smaller than 5 millimeters, have become a widespread concern. They can be found in oceans, rivers, soil, and even the air. Microplastics are often ingested by aquatic organisms, entering the food chain and potentially impacting human health.
        
                        <li>Soil Contamination: Improper disposal of plastic waste in landfills can contaminate the soil. As plastic breaks down over time, it releases harmful chemicals into the soil, affecting soil fertility and the growth of plants.
